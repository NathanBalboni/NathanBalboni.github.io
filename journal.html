		<h1> October 27 journal Entry / Jumpscare</h1>
		<p>We made jumpscares in class. The way it works is for the computer to listen to when I click. When this happens a scary photo and sound appear. Once I've clicked on the bucket of candy I want it to disapear so the photo takes up the whole screen. To do this I change the opacity.
